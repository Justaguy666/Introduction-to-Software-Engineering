	OVERVIEW
	* Project:
		- What's project?
			+ A series of works.
			
			+ Well-defined goal.
			
			+ Limited time.
			
		- Types of projects:
			+ Based on project goal.
			
			+ Production project -> product.
			
			+ Investment project -> benefit.
			
			+ Research project -> knowledge.
			
	* Software project:
		- Software is intangible (non-physical).
		
		- Software is flexible.
		
		- Software processes are flexible.
		
		- Software projet depends on human factors.
		
	* Software project management:
		- Guarantee successful project: Scope, time, budget.
		
		- Responsibility:
			+ Program manager.
			
			+ Project manager.
			
			+ Team lead.
			
			+ Test manager.
			
	* Project manager:
		- Project manager vs. Engineering manager.
		
		- Project manager:
			+ Leads the project team to achieve project objectives.
			
			+ Is one single important person for the project.
			
			+ Plays numerous roles of project management.
			
	* Software management activities: Initiation, planning, executing, tracking.
		- Initiation:
			+ Preliminary study and survey.
			
			+ Goals:
				# Feasibility study.
				
				# Scope identification.
				
				# Time & budget draft.
				
			+ Deliverables:
				# Feasibility report.
				
				# Project proposal.
				
		- Planning:
			+ Scope definition.
			
			+ Estimation.
			
			+ Scheduling.
			
		- Executing:
			+ Follow the master plan.
			
			+ Weekly plan:
				# Detailed tasks.
				
				# Assigned members.
				
				# Expected results.
				
		- Tracking:
			+ Guarantee plans are followed (3-W)
				# WHERE: are we?
				
				# WHAT: difficults?
				
				# WHY: have problems?
				
			+ Change management.

	PROJECT PLANNING
	* Defining goals, what, who, when (and how) to do.
	
	* Planning is a continuous activity:
		- Started early in project, lasted until the end of project.
		
		- Plans are revised to reflect reality.
		
	* Activities and artifacts created dependent on processes followed.
		-> Agile projects require less planning than tranditional projects.
		
	* Many different plans:
		- Software development plan (SDP):
			+ Budget and schedule.
			
			+ Staffing plan.
			
			+ Training plan.
			
			+ Risk management plan.
			
			+ Schedule.
			
			+ Monitoring and controlling.
			
		- Testing plan.
		
		- Deployment plan.
		
		- Configuration management plan.
		
		- Quality management plan.
		
		- Software acceptance plan.
		
	* Main activities to form SDP:
		- Estimate overall project effort, cost, and staff.
		
		- Plan phases, iterations.
		
		- Define and customize processes to use.
		
		- Assign roles and responsibilities to staff.
		
		- Plan training needs.
		
		- Identify and assess risks.
		
	* Scope definition:
		- Establishing the project's objectives and deliverables.
		
		- Work breakdown structure (WBS): Breaking down the project into
		smaller, manageable tasks or components.
		
	* Estimation:
		- Project estimation:
			+ Organizations need to make software effort and cost estimates.
			
			+ Experience-based techniques:
				# The estimate is based on the manager's experience of past projects
				and application domain.
				
				# The manager makes an informed judgement of what the effort requirements
				are likely to be.
				
			+ Algorithmic cost modeling: A formulaic approach is used to compute the project
			effort based on estimates of product attributes, such as size, and process characteristics,
			such as experience of staff involved.
				
	* Scheduling:
		- Project scheduling:
			+ Goal: Assigning right people to right tasks at right time.
			
			+ Activities:
				# Organize tasks concurrently to make optimal use of workforce.
				
				# Minimize task dependencies, slack time, and waiting time.
				
				# Balance workload.
				
			+ Scheduling is a challenging activity.
				-> Requiring much intuition and experience of project managers.
				
		- Challenges in project scheduling:
			+ Estimating each task is difficult:
				# Productivity is not proportional to the number of people working on a task.
				
				# Dependencies.
				
				# Resource constraints.
				
			+ Adding people to a late project makes it later.
				# Communication overheads.
				
				# Extra training.
				
			+ Unexpected things always happen: Allow contingency in planning.
			
		- Task organization:
			+ Organize tasks to produce tangible outputs.
			
			+ Milestones are the end-point of a period.
			
			+ Deliverables are results delivered to customers or users.
			
			+ Each milestone is often marked by a set of deliverables.

	RISK MANAGEMENT
	* Risk management:
		- Goal: Minimize effects of risks on project.
		
		- A risk is a probability that some adverse circumstance will occur.
		
		- Effects:
			+ Schedule or resources.
			
			+ Quality or performance of software.
			
			+ Cost.
			
			+ ...

			+ Categorical: Very low, low, moderate, high or very high.
			
			+ Numerical: From 0% to 100%.

		- Loss can be:
			+ Categorical: Catastrophic, serious, tolerable or insignificant.

		- Assess each identified risks regularly:
			+ Some risks may become less, some more probable.
			
			+ Maintain a list of top-10 risks.
			
			+ Review and revise risks regularly.
			
		- High prioritized risks should be:
			+ Reviewed and discussed at management progress meetings.
			
			+ Reported weekly.
			
		- Taking appropriate actions when problems occur.
